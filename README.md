# tomato-leaf-disease-detection

This Android application uses a machine learning model to detect and classify diseases in tomato leaves from images. Users can capture or upload photos of tomato leaves, and the app provides real-time predictions using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model. The project leverages the CameraX API for image capture, Glide for image loading, and includes a navigation drawer for easy access to app features.

Features
Image Capture and Upload: Capture photos with the device camera or upload from the gallery.
Disease Classification: Predicts diseases such as Tomato Mosaic Virus, Target Spot, and more.
Real-time Prediction: Provides quick results using an optimized on-device TFLite model.
User-friendly UI: Intuitive navigation with options for contact and about pages.
This project is ideal for research and practical applications in plant health monitoring and agricultural assistance.
